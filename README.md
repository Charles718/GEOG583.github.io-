# Smarter Maps with Big Data
Web mapping is no longer just about locationsâ€”it's about insights. With the rise of Big Data, maps now visualize real-time information from sources like GPS, social media, and sensors.

By turning complex data into interactive visuals, web maps help us spot trends, respond faster, and make smarter decisions. From city planning to crisis response, Big Data is powering the next generation of mapping.
